## 🌌 The Vision

Education has become a battle of logistics, not a journey of learning. We spend more time Managing documents than mastering concepts. **KALA** was born to change this.

By merging **Socratic pedagogical methods** with **Advanced Neural Ingestion**, KALA creates a dynamic environment where your assignments aren't just deadlines—they are interactive learning pathways.

---

## 🎭 Cinematic Feature Showcase

### 01. Neural Ingestion & Synthesis
Stop manual data entry. Feed KALA a complex Syllabus, a messy PDF, or even a photo of your notes.

### 02. The Cognitive Dashboard
Your entire academic velocity, visualized. Track mastery levels, upcoming pulses, and your "Daily Synapse" in one high-fidelity interface.
