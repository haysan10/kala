# 🎭 Cinematic Feature Deep-Dive

Welcome to the detailed exploration of **KALA**. This document provides an in-depth look at the core engines that drive the Academic Intelligence Operating System.

## 01. Neural Ingestion Engine
The entry point to the KALA ecosystem. Unlike traditional uploaders, the Ingestion Engine performs a multi-stage analysis of your academic materials.

### Key Capabilities:
- **OCR & Layout Analysis**: Parses complex PDFs, tables, and handwritten images.
- **Semantic Extraction**: Automatically identifies Learning Outcomes, Rubrics, and Milestones.
- **Context Preservation**: Links your assignment to the broader course structure.
- **Stealth Mode**: A minimalist text interface for raw context dumping without visual clutter.

### Visual Intelligence:
- **Mastery Pulse**: A real-time visualization of your comprehension across all active courses.
- **Velocity Tracker**: Measures your "Academic Throughput" to help you avoid burnout.
- **Daily Synapse**: A personalized micro-learning module generated every morning based on your weakest concepts.
- **Adaptive Roadmap**: Milestones that shift non-linearly based on your focus and mastery validation.

## 03. Socratic Sparring Room
The heartbeat of the learning process. KALA moves beyond generative chat into the realm of active pedagogical debate.

### The Methodology:
- **The Challenger AI**: If you provide an answer, KALA will find a counter-argument to test the depth of your knowledge.
- **Scaffolded Learning**: Complex concepts are broken down into "Neural Bites" that adapt to your prior knowledge.
- **Proof of Mastery**: You don't "finish" a milestone until you successfully defend your logic in the sparring room.

---

## 04. Automated Mini-Courses
For every project milestone, KALA synthesizes a custom-tailored curriculum.

### Inclusions:
- **Concept Synthesis**: High-density summaries of core theories.
- **Curated Assets**: AI-selected YouTube videos, research papers, and code snippets.
- **Diagnostic Sandbox**: Interactive environments where you can test your understanding before submitting your final work.

---

## 05. The Neural Vault (File Management)
Your academic legacy, intelligently indexed. 

- **Vector Search**: Search across all your documents by concept, not just keywords.
- **Cross-Linkage**: KALA identifies connections between different courses (e.g., linking a Linear Algebra concept to a Machine Learning assignment).
